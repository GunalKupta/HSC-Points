# HSC-Points
This Google Apps Script project is attached to the TAMU Honors Student Council points masterlist. It allows an officer to easily update the points for all 5000+ students with new event reports with a simple Google Form to automatically import the event attendance spreadsheet. In addition, it provides a mobile-responsive web application interface for HSC member students to view their points status, displaying a list of each event they attended for the semester and whether or not they have fulfilled requirements. The web app can be accessed at [tx.ag/HSCPoints](https://tx.ax/HSCPoints) (need to log in using @tamu.edu Google account) and the real-time visit statistics can be found at [tx.ag/HSCPoints+](https://tx.ax/HSCPoints+).
